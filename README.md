# Blog API v1

https://github.com/sollertis8/Blog-API

• Serves client that:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• makes AJAX calls back to API endpoints to initially retrieve and display existing blog posts  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• allows users to read, create, update , and delete blog posts  
• Uses express.Router to route requests for /blog-posts to a separate module  
• CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for blog posts  
• Note: uses volatile, in memory storage, since we haven't studied data persistence yet in the course
